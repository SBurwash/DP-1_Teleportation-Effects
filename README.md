# Dumb Project #1
## How would teleporation affect the world?

As part of my ongoing proejct of trying to use my pent up anxiety semi-productivaly, I have decided to start a series of "Dumb Projects" where I attempt to answer the series of whacky questions that plague my mind.

First idea :bulb: : *The effects of the advent of teleporation on society*

Teleportation is one of those science-fiction concepts which, on the surface at least, everyone would agree sounds awesome. Instatly moving from place to place, no more commutes, going to France for the weekend, *actual* instant shipping from amazon, etc. Sounds amazing, right?

But then, once the high of imagining taking a lunch break in Singapour starts to wane, you slowly start thinking that instantaneous travel may have more of an impact, positive or negative, than just being accomodating for impromptue vacations.

### What would actually happen
